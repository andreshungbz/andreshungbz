### Howdy!
My name is Andres Hung and I'm doing my Associate's Degree in IT at the University of Belize. I've switched my major after the late period of finishing my Associate's in Biology and Chemistry (oops!) but at least I can tell you how Van der Waals intermolecular forces are caused by instantaenous dipole moments and that tert-Butyldimethylsilyl ethers are great for protecting the alcohol group in organic synthesis. 

Anyways, I like computers and drawing cartoon animals.
